## Practical L7-L8

This practical covers the basics of probabilistic modeling and inference in a universal probabilistic programming system, following and extending the introductory Pyro tutorials on [modeling](http://pyro.ai/examples/intro_part_i.html) and [inference](http://pyro.ai/examples/intro_part_ii.html).

#### Part 1a
Basic introduction to modelling and inference using Pyro

#### Part 1b
Training a Bayesian neural network with Pyro and SVI

The solution notebooks are included; please only look at these if you are really stuck. Alternatively, ask the instructors for help.
