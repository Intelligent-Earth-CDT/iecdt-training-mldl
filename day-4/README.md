## Introduction to Neural Networks in PyTorch: Exploring Activation Functions, Regularization, and Optimization Techniques

Practical designed by [Qurat ul ain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qurat-ul-ain95).

In this session, you will build a deep neural network using Pytorch.


### Objectives
- Build a feedforward neural network for image classification.
- Experiment with different activation functions and observe their effects.
- Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
- Tune the optimization process and observe the impact of different optimizers and learning rates.
- Learn model checkpointing and Early stopping
- Set up WandB
### Required packages:

[1] [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) is library widely used for bulding deep-learning frameworks

[2] [TorchVision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html) you can use available datasets that include one you are required to use in this tutorial (CIFAR10) and also use augmentations (meaning you can increase data variability for improved accuracy and model generalisation)

[3] [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) can be used for plotting graphs in python

[4] (Optional) [Wandb](https://wandb.ai/site) is used to automate visualization of your training development - It is important to observe it.
