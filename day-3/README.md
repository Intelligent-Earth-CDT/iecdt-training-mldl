## Practical 3

Practical designed by [Qurat ul ain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qurat-ul-ain95).

In this session, you will build a deep neural network, with as many layers as you want! You will implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network from scratch (without using Pytorch).

**After this practical you will be able to:**
- Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
- Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
- Implement an easy-to-use neural network class

The packages that you will need during this assignment are: 
- [numpy](www.numpy.org) is the main package for scientific computing with Python.
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a library to plot graphs in Python.
- dnn_utils provides some necessary functions for this notebook.
- testCases provides some test cases to assess the correctness of your functions
- np.random.seed(1) is used to keep all the random function calls consistent. It will help us grade your work. Please don't change the seed. 


This practical is based on Coursera Deep Learning specialization offered by deeplearning.ai - but please don't look at it unless you are really stuck!
