## Practical L3-L4

This practical is going to review the implementation of the minimal automatic differentiation (differentiable programming) system by Andrej Karpathy, called [micrograd](
https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

Note: another minimal implementation is [autodidact](https://github.com/mattjj/autodidact) by Matthew Johnson, which is a minimal pedagogical implementation of the [autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd) package wrapping Numpy arrays (whereas the Karpathy micrograd is based on differentiable scalar types). The students are encouraged to check this project's source as an extra activity.
